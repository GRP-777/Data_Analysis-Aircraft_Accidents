## Disclaimer <a name="disclaimer"></a>

It is important to clarify and emphasize that the purpose of the proposed projects is exclusively pedagogical. The objective is to carry out projects that simulate a work environment, in which various topics are addressed that are relevant to reality. The projects do not reflect data or real studies outside the academic environment. Students and/or anyone reading the repositories (and project submissions) are not encouraged or advised to take actions based on the data that they may or may not have collected. All information presented and results obtained in the project should never be taken into account for real decision-making (especially in the areas of finance, health, politics, etc.).


## Introduction and Context <a name="introduction"></a>

The air transport industry is closely related to safety procedures. The priceless human lives and the high economic investment on airplanes requires the top procedures to prevent accidents. Considering flights number increaser over time because of the demographics and economy growth, to preserve safety first is a must. Over the years, engineers has focused their efforts in decreasing the aircraft fatalities. The object of this analysis is to find out if this effort reflects in the studied data. 

The nature of aircraft accidents vary depending on the type of flight (experimental, military, civilian), unplanned events (weather, war, pilot's error, technical issue), and many other possibilities. This analysis wants to find out if the fatalities has decreased over the time, considering some of the previously mentioned possibilities. To find out if this objective has been achieved, we compare :a: the overall aircraft crew fatality rate over time and :b: the militar vs civilian crew fatality rate over time.

:arrow_right: On this context, only two decades concern to this analysis, the current and the one before. This is a bounded study, so it will give results of a specific time and data frame. Not all of the possibilities are considered yet, so please do not consider this results as a final conclusion, but a part to get to it. 

:arrow_forward: This analysis takes the dataset provided by the International Civil Aviation Organization, part of the United Nations. It looks for the relationship between the number of crew fatalities and the different time frames. Also, the information is supported by other elements, some inferences will be generated by showing in an interactive dashboard the number of flights over the time to back the fact that the fatalities/time rate considers multiple factors. Another keypoint is the relationship between military and civilian type of flight. 

In summary, this exploratory analysis seeks to clarify some of the reasons around aircraft accidents, having in mind militar and civilian crew fatalities, hoping to contribute with new points of view on this complex problem.

## Datasets <a name="datasets"></a>

The used information was provided by the academic institution Soy Henry, located in Argentina.
- [Original dataset](https://github.com/GRP-777/Data_Analysis-Aircraft_Accidents/blob/master/AccidentesAviones.csv)
- [Generated dataset](https://github.com/GRP-777/Data_Analysis-Aircraft_Accidents/blob/master/AircraftAccidentsFinalF.csv)


## Extract Transform Load<a name="etl"></a>

Acces to the Notebook → [ETL and EDA](https://github.com/GRP-777/Data_Analysis-Aircraft_Accidents/blob/master/AA_ETL_EDA_Notebook.ipynb)

Work stages:
- Transform null
- Convert "%B %d, %Y" on 'Date' column type to only year integer
- Create a 'Season' column, based on another 'Month' column also generated
- Drop columns with mostly only NaN
- Create 'Country' column derivated from the 'Route' column

## Exploratory Data Analysis <a name="eda"></a>

First analysis attempt for KPI #2: accidents related in 'Aircraft Type'
- Check null values in 'Aircraft Type'
- Check header
- Generate list to look at all registers
- Tried different types of libraries to automatize a way to categorize different types
- Manual categorization would be too extense
- Drop KPI

Second analysis attempt for KPI #2: accidents related in 'Flight Type', military or civilian
- Stablish keywords to categorize values ('Military', 'Navy', etc.)
- Create list of synonyms using syn.lemmas
- Generate new column
- Information is enough to use in analysis
- Second KPI is defined

Outliers verification:
- Check max and min values on all the **numeric values columns** ('All Aboard', 'Total fatalities', 'Crew Aboard', 'Crew Fatalities', 'Passengers Aboard', 'Passengers Fatalities')
- Use .describe() to get overall statistics
- Drop some irregular values. This doesn't check with the rest of the data, also it's impossible to have, for example, 24 aboard and 213 fatalities
- Confirmation of the max amount of fatalities, it checks with the max historic
  
Plot and line graphing. This topic it's better displayed in the next Dashboard section.
